# Navigation-stack-using-Sensor-Fusion
Buiding a Navigation stack using sensors - GNSS module and VectorNav VN-100 IMU

This project contains the creation of a navigation stack using sensor fusion involved building device drivers in Python for data acquisition from a GNSS module and a VectorNav VN-100 IMU. These drivers were integrated into a single launch file in a ROS environment and used to collect data from the sensors. The collected data was then analyzed using MATLAB, including magnetometer calibration and dead reckoning calculations.
